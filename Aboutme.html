                    <p>If you have made it to this page, hello! My name is Jason Bilawsky. I am currently a
                        junior at NJIT studying Information Technology with an expected graduation date of May 2024.
                        I am a member of bowling team at NJIT, as well as competitive bowler outside of college.
                        I have bowled 6 perfect games in my lifetime and my high series is 799. After two years, my college
                        average is 194
                        (current as of 09/01/23). <br>
                        Outside of bowling, I enjoy being outdoors doing things such as hiking and going on bike rides.
                        I enjoy walking around with friends or going on late night drives. I occasionally play video games as 
                        well, with Minecraft, Super Mario Galaxy and Ori and the Blind Forest being 3 of my favorites. While not 
                        very successful, I am attempting to learn to play the guitar. It has always seemed fun to me to be able
                        to just pick up a guitar and play, so after discovering there was one sitting in my basement, I had to try.
                        Hopefully one day I can find the patience to get good at it.
