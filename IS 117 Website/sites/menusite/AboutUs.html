            Blue Robin started from a barbeque in 2018. We told everyone that we would bring chicken to the event, and everyone
            was amazed with how good it was. After that, we decided to take a risk and open our own restaurant in early 2019. Immediately, everybody
            loved our chicken, and business was doing great. When covid first began we struggled a little bit, but were able to successfully recover by the end
            of 2020 once we broadened our menu beyond simply chicken when we started selling various appetizers and deserts, and became more of a restaurant
            than a fast food joint. Ever since, we have tried many new things on our menu, including a few breakfast options and different sauces/dry rubs for 
            our chicken. We believe in serving the freshest, finest food available.
